Module 2: Section loop

Extraction:
- Scope capture: Extract text for the current section, excluding references and captions unless explicitly part of the section.
- Key signal detection: Identify objectives, methods, results, limitations.

Summarization:
- Bullet drafting: Create three bullets (four for abstract/conclusion) with unique points.
- Language level: Generate expert and lay variants for later rendering.

Constraint checks:
- Length: <200 words per section.
- Uniqueness: No repeated bullets; each expresses a distinct idea.
- Factuality: Match phrasing to original text; avoid external claims.
