### **Module 1 — Intake & Setup** 

Normalize sections:
- Parse headings: Detect actual section titles and map them to the provided list.
- Canonicalize names: Standardize casing and numbering (e.g., “1. Introduction” → “Introduction”).
- Align structure: Handle nested subsections; collapse or roll-up if needed.

Detect issues:
- Missing sections: Mark sections present in the list but absent in text.
- Short sections: Flag sections with <50 words.
- Empty content: Identify headings with no substantive text.

Metadata setup:
- Audience: Default to “Lay” if not provided.
- Limits: Set per-section word budgets and bullet counts.
- Chunking plan: Pre-plan splits for very long sections.
