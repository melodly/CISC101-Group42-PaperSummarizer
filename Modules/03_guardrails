## Change Log (Nov 2025)
- Added `evidence_mode = "strict"` to prevent unsupported claims.
- Added explicit instructions for strict evidence summaries and missing-info messages.
- Added standardized warnings for missing, empty, and very short sections.
- Preserved original guardrails while strengthening evidence and hallucination control.

Module 3: Guardrails

### Missing/ Empty sections:
- Warnings: Add explicit notes for missing or empty sections in “Checks & Warnings.”
- No invention: Do not fabricate content for absent sections.
- Standardized message (new):
  - “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”

### Short sections (<50 words):
- Flag: Mark and keep summaries minimal; indicate limited content.
- Standardized message (new):
  - “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”

### Strict Evidence Mode (New Requirement)

Introduce a flag:
- **`evidence_mode`** ∈ {"strict", "default"}

When `evidence_mode = "strict"`:
- Only include claims, equations, results, and concepts that appear **explicitly** in the provided text.
- Do not infer missing details, interpretations, or context.
- If the source text lacks enough information to produce a summary, output:
  - “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”

### Hallucination mitigation:
- Source tethering: Each bullet must be traceable to the section’s text.
- Term validation: Avoid undefined acronyms; define or remove if unsupported.

---

### Long-paper chunking:
- Segment: Break sections into logical sub-chunks (e.g., paragraphs) before summarizing.
- Aggregate: Combine chunk summaries into final bullets while preserving constraints.
