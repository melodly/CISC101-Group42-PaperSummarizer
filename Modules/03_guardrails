Module 3: Guardrails

Missing/empty sections:
- Warnings: Add explicit notes for missing or empty sections in “Checks & Warnings.”
- No invention: Do not fabricate content for absent sections.

Short sections (<50 words):
- Flag: Mark and keep summaries minimal; indicate limited content.

Hallucination mitigation:
- Source tethering: Each bullet must be traceable to the section’s text.
- Term validation: Avoid undefined acronyms; define or remove if unsupported.

Long-paper chunking:
- Segment: Break sections into logical sub-chunks (e.g., paragraphs) before summarizing.
- Aggregate: Combine chunk summaries into final bullets while preserving constraints.
