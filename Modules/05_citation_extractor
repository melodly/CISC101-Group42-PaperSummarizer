Module 5: Citation extractor

Detection:
- In-text citations: Identify patterns like “[12]”, “(Smith et al., 2017)”, numeric superscripts, and reference-style anchors.
- Separation: Extract citations and map them to the references section when available.

Summarization:
- Context linkage: Summarize what each citation supports (method, dataset, prior work).
- Output: Provide a separate list of citations with brief roles, distinct from main summaries.

Integration:
- No mixing: Do not include citations inside summary bullets or table cells.
- Traceability: Maintain citation-to-section mapping for audits.
