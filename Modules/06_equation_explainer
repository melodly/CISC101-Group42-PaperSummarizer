Module 6: Equation explainer

Detection:
- Equation patterns: Identify display math and inline math (e.g., LaTeX delimiters, numbered equations).
- Complexity filter: Flag equations with multiple terms, matrices, or attention/scoring functions.

Explanation:
- Purpose: Describe what the equation is used for (e.g., scoring, normalization, optimization).
- Plain-language breakdown: Define each symbol and the overall computation flow.
- Connection to results: Explain how the equation supports findings or model behavior.

Output:
- Standalone notes: Provide a dedicated “Equation Explainer” section separate from summaries.
- Audience variants: Offer both expert and lay explanations per equation.
