Module 4: Rendering & refinement

Final summary structure:
- Paper summary: 6–10 bullets covering motivation, method, results, and limitations.
- Section-by-section table: One row per section with required bullet counts.

Formatting consistency:
- Lead-ins: Use bold lead-in labels for bullets where helpful (e.g., “Method,” “Result”).
- Tables: Keep to essential columns; no citations inside cells.

Variants:
- Expert summary: Precise terminology and details; still <200 words per section.
- Lay summary: Plain language, brief analogies, term definitions inline.

Quality pass:
- Deduplication: Remove redundant points across sections.
- Constraint enforcement: Re-check word counts, bullet counts, and warnings.
