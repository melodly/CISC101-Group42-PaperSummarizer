Purpose: The Paper Summarizer exists to make complex academic research accessible, structured, and understandable for different audiences. Academic papers are often dense, technical, and difficult to navigate — especially for readers without a research background. This system solves that problem by:

- Breaking down papers into digestible sections that are summarized into concise bullet points, ensuring readers can quickly grasp the main ideas without wading through technical jargon.
- Maintaining accuracy and integrity The system enforces strict guardrails: no hallucinated sections, no invented citations, and summaries capped at 200 words per section. This ensures the output is faithful to the paper.

Adding clarity through extras modules: 
- Citation Extractor: Separates references from the main text and explains their role.
- Equation Explainer: Breaks down mathematical formulas into plain language, showing how they support the paper’s findings.
